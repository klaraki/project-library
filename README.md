# Project Name
I have done a website for "my favorite recipes". 
There are one filter function where the user can filter the recipes by country. There are also one sorting-function where the user can sort the recipes based on estimated cooking time. 

## The problem
First, all recipes in the object are displayed by a for each-loop. The loop goes through each recipe in the object, creating a div that displays the header, image, and estimated cooking time.
The filter-function is made with the filter()-method, creating a temporary arrow that contains only the recipes that have a 'cuisineType' that matches the selected value from the dropdown. 
The sorting-function is made with the sorting()-method, with one ascending sorting and one descending, based on the user's selected value. 

I tried to break the project down to smaller functions, focusing on what I wanted the outcome to be like. For example, when creating the filter-function, I had a process in my head describing what value I wanted to use, how I could get the references (cuisineType), and if I could reuse the loadRecipes-function that I had already created to display all the recipes. 

If I had more time I would've looked at the stretch goals this week and perhaps try to make a search bar, that would be nice to know how-to. 
I'd also put more time on the design, but considering that this is a JS course I didn't focus on this.
